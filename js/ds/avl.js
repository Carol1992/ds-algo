/**
 * AVL tree is a self balancing binary search tree, the heights of the 2 child subtree differ by at most one.
 * the balance factor of any node: {-1, 0, 1}
 * single element operations: searching, traversal, insert, delete, rebalancing
 * set operations: union, intersection and set difference; helper operations: Split and Join
 * retracing: after insertion or deletion, check each of the node's ancestors for consistency with the variants of avl tree.
